Testing of changes and building of the manual
=============================================

Install the python tox package and run "tox" from the top-level
directory to use the same tests that are done as part of our Jenkins
gating jobs.

If you like to run individual tests, run:
* "tox -e checkniceness" - to run the niceness tests
* "tox -e checksyntax" - to run syntax checks
* "tox -e checkdeletions" - to check that no deleted files are referenced
* "tox -e checkbuild" - to actually build the manual

tox will use the openstack-doc-tools package for execution of these
tests.
