Prerequisites
=============

To build the documentation locally, you must install Python and
`Python Tox <https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

To install Tox for Ubuntu 14.04 or later::

    apt-get install python-tox python-dev libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev

To build all the documentation after installing Python and Tox::

    tox -e docs

To build an individual document, such as the API Guide::

    tox -e api-quick-start

The locally-built output files are found in a ``publish-docs`` directory.

"Writing your First OpenStack Application" tutorial
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To build the "Writing your first OpenStack application" tutorial, you must
install `Graphviz <http://www.graphviz.org/>`_.

To install Graphviz for Ubuntu 12.04 or later or Debian 7 ("wheezy") or later::

    apt-get install graphviz

On Fedora 22 and later::

    dnf install graphviz

On openSUSE::

    zypper install graphviz

On Mac OSX with Homebrew installed::

    brew install graphviz

Build and update API docs
=========================

Refer to the `OpenStack Documentation Contributor Guide
<https://docs.openstack.org/doc-contrib-guide/api-guides.html>`_
for more information.

Run tests
=========

To use the same tests that are used as part of our Jenkins gating jobs,
install the Python tox package and run ``tox`` from the top-level directory.

To run individual tests:

 * ``tox -e linters`` - Niceness tests
 * ``tox -e checkbuild`` - Builds all of the documents in this repository

To run these tests, the Tox package uses the
`OpenStack doc tools package
<https://opendev.org/openstack/openstack-doc-tools>`_.
