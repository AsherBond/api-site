Prerequisites
=============

To build the documentation locally, you must install Python and
`Python Tox <https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

To install Tox for Ubuntu 14.04 or later::

    apt-get install python-tox python-dev libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev

To build all the documentation after installing Python and Tox::

    tox -e docs

To build an individual document, such as the API Guide::

    tox -e api-quick-start

The locally-built output files are found in a ``publish-docs`` directory.

Run tests
=========

To use the same tests that are used as part of our Jenkins gating jobs,
install the Python tox package and run ``tox`` from the top-level directory.

To run individual tests:

 * ``tox -e checkbuild`` - Builds all of the documents in this repository
