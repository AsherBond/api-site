Getting started
===============

Who should read this book?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This book is for software developers who want to deploy applications to
OpenStack clouds.

We assume that you're an experienced programmer who has not created a cloud
application in general or an OpenStack application in particular.

If you're familiar with OpenStack, this section teaches you how to program
with its components.

What you will learn?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Deploying applications in a cloud environment can be very different from the
traditional IT approach. You will learn how to deploy applications on
OpenStack and some best practices for cloud application development. Overall,
this guide covers:

* :doc:`/section1`: The most basic cloud application -- creating and
  destroying virtual resources
* :doc:`/section2`: The architecture of a sample cloud-based application
* :doc:`/section3`: The importance of message queues
* :doc:`/section4`: Scaling up and down in response to changes in
  application load
* :doc:`/section5`: Using object or block storage to create persistence
* :doc:`/section6`: Orchestrating your cloud for better control of the
  environment
* :doc:`/section7`: Networking choices and actions to help relieve
  potential congestion
* :doc:`/section8`: Advice for developers who may not have been
  exposed to operations tasks before
* :doc:`/section9`: Taking your application to the next level by
  spreading it across multiple regions or clouds

A general overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This tutorial actually involves two applications; the first, a fractal
generator, simply uses mathematical equations to generate
images. We'll provide that application to you in its entirety, because
really, it's just an excuse; the real application we will be showing
you is the code that enables you to make use of OpenStack to run
it. That application includes:

* Creating and destroying compute resources. (Those are the virtual
  machine instances on which the Fractals application runs.)
* Cloud-related architecture decisions, such as breaking individual
  functions out into micro-services and modularizing them.
* Scaling up and down to customize the amount of available resources.
* Object and block storage for file and database persistence.
* Orchestration services to automatically adjust to the environment.
* Networking customization for better performance and segregation.
* A few other crazy things we think ordinary folks won't want to do ;).


Choosing your OpenStack SDK
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Future versions of this book will cover completing these tasks with
various toolkits, such as the OpenStack SDK, and using various
languages, such as Java or Ruby. For now, however, this initial
incarnation focuses on using Python with Apache Libcloud. That said,
if you're not a master Python programmer, don't despair; the code is
fairly straightforward, and should be readable to anyone with a
programming background.

If you're a developer for an alternate toolkit and would like to see this book
support it, great!  Please feel free to submit alternate code snippets, or to
contact any of the authors or members of the Documentation team to coordinate.

Although this guide (initially) covers only Libcloud, you actually have several
choices when it comes to building an application for an OpenStack cloud.
These choices include:

A list of all available SDKs is available on the
`OpenStack wiki <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/SDKs>`_.


What you need
-------------

We assume you already have access to an OpenStack cloud.  You should
have a project (tenant) with a quota of at least six instances. The
Fractals application itself runs in Ubuntu, Debian, and Fedora-based
and openSUSE-based distributions, so you'll need to be creating
instances using one of these operating systems.

Interact with the cloud itself, you will also need to have

.. only:: dotnet

      `OpenStack SDK for Microsoft .NET 0.9.1 or better installed
      <https://www.nuget.org/packages/OpenStack-SDK-DotNet>`_.
      .. warning:: This document has not yet been completed for the .NET SDK.

.. only:: fog

      `fog 1.19 or better installed
      <http://www.fogproject.org/wiki/index.php?title=FOGUserGuide#Installing_FOG>`_
      and working with ruby gems 1.9.
      .. warning:: This document has not yet been completed for the fog SDK.

.. only:: jclouds

    `jClouds 1.8 or better installed
    <https://jclouds.apache.org/start/install>`_.
    .. warning:: This document has not yet been completed for the jclouds SDK.

.. only:: libcloud

  `libcloud 0.15.1 or better installed
  <https://libcloud.apache.org/getting-started.html>`_.

.. only:: node

      `a recent version of pkgcloud installed
      <https://github.com/pkgcloud/pkgcloud#getting-started>`_.

      .. warning::

         This document has not yet been completed for the pkgcloud
         SDK.

.. only:: openstacksdk

    the OpenStack SDK installed.
    .. warning::

       This document has not yet been completed for the OpenStack SDK.

.. only:: phpopencloud

    `a recent version of php-opencloud installed
    <http://docs.php-opencloud.com/en/latest/>`_.
    .. warning::

       This document has not yet been completed for the php-opencloud
       SDK.


You need the following information, which you can
obtain from your cloud provider:

* auth URL
* user name
* password
* project ID or name (projects are also known as tenants.)
* cloud region

You can also get this information by downloading the OpenStack RC file
from the OpenStack dashboard. To download this file, log in to the
Horizon dashboard and click :guilabel:`Project->Access & Security->API
Access->Download OpenStack RC file`.  If you choose this route, be
aware that the "auth URL" doesn't include the path.  For example,
if your :file:`openrc.sh` file shows:

.. code-block:: bash

        export OS_AUTH_URL=http://controller:5000/v2.0

the actual auth URL will be

.. code-block:: python

        http://controller:5000


How you'll interact with OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Throughout this tutorial, you'll be interacting with your OpenStack cloud
through code, using one of the SDKs listed in section "Choosing your OpenStack
SDK". In this initial version, the code snippets assume that you're using
libcloud.

.. only:: fog

    .. literalinclude:: ../../samples/fog/section1.rb
        :start-after: step-1
        :end-before: step-2

.. only:: libcloud

    To try it out, add the following code to a Python script (or use an
    interactive Python shell) by calling :code:`python -i`.

    .. literalinclude:: ../../samples/libcloud/section1.py
        :start-after: step-1
        :end-before: step-2

.. only:: openstacksdk

    .. code-block:: python

      from openstack import connection
      conn = connection.Connection(auth_url="http://controller:5000/v3",
                                   user_name="your_auth_username",
                                   password="your_auth_password", ...)


.. note:: We'll use the :code:`conn` object throughout the tutorial,
          so ensure you always have one handy.

.. only:: libcloud

    .. note:: If you receive the exception
              :code:`libcloud.common.types.InvalidCredsError: 'Invalid
              credentials with the provider'` while trying to run one
              of the following API calls please double-check your
              credentials.

    .. note:: If your provider says they do not use regions, try a
              blank string ('') for the `region_name`.

Flavors and images
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run your application, you must create a virtual machine, or launch an
instance. This instance behaves like a normal server.

To launch an instance, you must choose a flavor and an image. The flavor is
essentially the size of the instance, such as its number of CPUs, and the
amount of RAM and disk. An image is a prepared OS installation from which your
instance is cloned. When you boot instances, larger flavors can be more
expensive than smaller ones (in terms of resources and therefore monetary
cost if you're working in a public cloud).

You can easily list the images that are available in your cloud by
running some API calls:

.. only:: fog

    .. literalinclude:: ../../samples/fog/section1.rb
        :start-after: step-2
        :end-before: step-3

.. only:: libcloud

    .. literalinclude:: ../../samples/libcloud/section1.py
        :start-after: step-2
        :end-before: step-3

    You should see a result something like:

    .. code-block:: python

        <NodeImage: id=2cccbea0-cea9-4f86-a3ed-065c652adda5, name=ubuntu-14.04, driver=OpenStack  ...>
        <NodeImage: id=f2a8dadc-7c7b-498f-996a-b5272c715e55, name=cirros-0.3.3-x86_64, driver=OpenStack  ...>

You can also get information about available flavors:

.. only:: fog

    .. literalinclude:: ../../samples/fog/section1.rb
        :start-after: step-3
        :end-before: step-4

.. only:: libcloud

    .. literalinclude:: ../../samples/libcloud/section1.py
        :start-after: step-3
        :end-before: step-4

    This code produces output like:

    .. code-block:: python

        <OpenStackNodeSize: id=1, name=m1.tiny, ram=512, disk=1, bandwidth=None, price=0.0, driver=OpenStack, vcpus=1,  ...>
        <OpenStackNodeSize: id=2, name=m1.small, ram=2048, disk=20, bandwidth=None, price=0.0, driver=OpenStack, vcpus=1,  ...>
        <OpenStackNodeSize: id=3, name=m1.medium, ram=4096, disk=40, bandwidth=None, price=0.0, driver=OpenStack, vcpus=2,  ...>
        <OpenStackNodeSize: id=4, name=m1.large, ram=8192, disk=80, bandwidth=None, price=0.0, driver=OpenStack, vcpus=4,  ...>
        <OpenStackNodeSize: id=5, name=m1.xlarge, ram=16384, disk=160, bandwidth=None, price=0.0, driver=OpenStack, vcpus=8,  ...>


Your images and flavors will be different, of course.

Choose an image and flavor for your first instance. You need about 1GB of RAM,
1 CPU, and 1 GB of disk. In this example, the :code:`m1.small` flavor, which
exceeds these requirements, in conjunction with the Ubuntu image, is a safe
choice. The flavor and image you choose here is used throughout this guide, so
you must change the IDs in the following tutorial sections to correspond to
your desired flavor and image.

If the image you want is not available in your cloud, you can usually upload a
new one, depending on your cloud's policy settings. For information about how
to upload images, see `obtaining images <http://docs.openstack.org/image-guide/content/ch_obtaining_images.html>`_.

Set the image and size variables to appropriate values for your cloud. We'll
use these in later sections.

First tell the connection to retrieve a specific image, using the ID of the
image you have chosen to work with in the previous section:

.. only:: fog

    .. literalinclude:: ../../samples/fog/section1.rb
        :start-after: step-4
        :end-before: step-5

.. only:: libcloud

    .. literalinclude:: ../../samples/libcloud/section1.py
        :start-after: step-4
        :end-before: step-5

    You should see output something like this:

    .. code-block:: python

         <NodeImage: id=2cccbea0-cea9-4f86-a3ed-065c652adda5, name=ubuntu-14.04, driver=OpenStack  ...>

Next tell the script what flavor you want to use:

.. only:: fog

    .. literalinclude:: ../../samples/fog/section1.rb
        :start-after: step-5
        :end-before: step-6


.. only:: libcloud

    .. literalinclude:: ../../samples/libcloud/section1.py
        :start-after: step-5
        :end-before: step-6

    You should see output something like this:

    .. code-block:: python

        <OpenStackNodeSize: id=3, name=m1.medium, ram=4096, disk=40, bandwidth=None, price=0.0, driver=OpenStack, vcpus=2,  ...>

Now you're ready to actually launch the instance.

Booting an instance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now that you have selected an image and flavor, use it to create an instance.

.. only:: libcloud

    .. note:: The following instance creation assumes that you have only one
              tenant network. If you have multiple tenant networks, you must add a
              networks parameter to the create_node call. You'll know this is the
              case if you see an error stating 'Exception: 400 Bad Request Multiple
              possible networks found, use a Network ID to be more specific.' See
              :doc:`/appendix` for details.

Start by creating the instance.

.. note:: An instance may be called a 'node' or 'server' by your SDK.

.. only:: fog

    .. literalinclude:: ../../samples/fog/section1.rb
        :start-after: step-6
        :end-before: step-7

.. only:: libcloud

    .. literalinclude:: ../../samples/libcloud/section1.py
        :start-after: step-6
        :end-before: step-7

    You should see output something like:

    .. code-block:: python

       <Node: uuid=1242d56cac5bcd4c110c60d57ccdbff086515133, name=testing, state=PENDING, public_ips=[], private_ips=[], provider=OpenStack ...>

.. only:: openstacksdk

    .. code-block:: python

       args = {
           "name": "testing",
           "flavorRef": flavor,
           "imageRef": image,
       }
       instance = conn.compute.create_server(**args)

If you then output a list of existing instances...

.. only:: fog

    .. literalinclude:: ../../samples/fog/section1.rb
        :start-after: step-7
        :end-before: step-8

.. only:: libcloud

    .. literalinclude:: ../../samples/libcloud/section1.py
        :start-after: step-7
        :end-before: step-8

... you should see the new instance appear.

.. only:: libcloud

    .. code-block:: python

       <Node: uuid=1242d56cac5bcd4c110c60d57ccdbff086515133, name=testing, state=RUNNING, public_ips=[], private_ips=[], provider=OpenStack ...>

.. only:: openstacksdk

    .. code-block:: python

       instances = conn.compute.list_servers()
       for instance in instances:
           print(instance)

Before we move on, there's one more thing you must do.

Destroying an instance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Cloud resources, including running instances that you no longer use, can cost
money. Removing cloud resources can help you avoid any unexpected costs.

.. only:: fog

    .. literalinclude:: ../../samples/fog/section1.rb
        :start-after: step-8
        :end-before: step-9

.. only:: libcloud

    .. literalinclude:: ../../samples/libcloud/section1.py
        :start-after: step-8
        :end-before: step-9


If you list the instances again, you'll see that the instance no longer
appears.

Leave your shell open, as you will use it for another instance
deployment in this section.

Deploy the application to a new instance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now that you are familiar with how to create and destroy instances, you can
deploy the sample application. The instance that you create for the
application is similar to the first instance that you created, but this time,
we'll briefly introduce a few extra concepts.

.. note:: Internet connectivity from your cloud instance is required
          to download the application.

When you create an instance for the application, you're going to want
to give it a bit more information than the bare instance we created
and destroyed a little while ago. We'll go into more detail in later
sections, but for now, simply create these resources so you can feed
them to the instance:

* A key pair. To access your instance, you must import an SSH public key
  into OpenStack to create a key pair. OpenStack installs this key pair on the
  new instance. Typically, your public key is written to
  :code:`.ssh/id_rsa.pub`. If you do not have an SSH public key file, follow
  the instructions `here <https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/>`_
  first. We'll cover this in depth in section 2.

.. only:: fog

    .. warning:: This section has not been completed.

.. only:: libcloud

    In the following example, :code:`pub_key_file` should be set to
    the location of your public SSH key file.

    .. literalinclude:: ../../samples/libcloud/section1.py
        :start-after: step-9
        :end-before: step-10

    ::

       <KeyPair name=demokey fingerprint=aa:bb:cc... driver=OpenStack>

* Network access. By default, OpenStack filters all traffic. You must
  create a security group that allows HTTP and SSH access and apply it to
  your instance. We'll go into more detail in section 2.

.. only:: fog

    .. literalinclude:: ../../samples/fog/section1.rb
        :start-after: step-10
        :end-before: step-11

.. only:: libcloud

    .. literalinclude:: ../../samples/libcloud/section1.py
        :start-after: step-10
        :end-before: step-11

* Userdata. During instance creation, userdata may be provided to OpenStack to
  configure instances after they boot. The userdata is applied to an instance
  by the cloud-init service. This service should be pre-installed on the image
  you have chosen. We'll go into more detail in section 2.

.. only:: fog

    .. warning:: This section has not been completed.

.. only:: libcloud

    .. literalinclude:: ../../samples/libcloud/section1.py
        :start-after: step-11
        :end-before: step-12

Now you're ready to boot and configure the new instance.

Booting and configuring an instance
-----------------------------------

Use the image, flavor, key pair, and userdata to create a new instance. After
requesting the new instance, wait for it to finish.

.. only:: fog

    .. warning:: This section has not been completed.

.. only:: libcloud

    .. literalinclude:: ../../samples/libcloud/section1.py
        :start-after: step-12
        :end-before: step-13

When the instance boots up, the information in the ex_userdata
variable tells it to go ahead and deploy the Fractals application.

Associating a Floating IP for external connectivity
---------------------------------------------------

We'll cover networking in greater detail in section 7, but in order to
actually see the application running, you'll need to know where to
look for it. Your instance will have outbound network access by
default, but in order to provision inbound network access (in other
words, to make it reachable from the Internet) you will need an IP
address. In some cases, your instance may be provisioned with a
publicly rout-able IP by default. You'll be able to tell in this case
because when you list the instances you'll see an IP address listed
under `public_ips` or `private_ips`.

If not, then you'll need to create a floating IP and attach it to your
instance.

.. only:: fog

    .. warning:: This section has not been completed.

.. only:: libcloud

    Use :code:`ex_list_floating_ip_pools()` and select the first pool of
    Floating IP addresses. Allocate this to your project and attach it
    to your instance.

    .. literalinclude:: ../../samples/libcloud/section1.py
        :start-after: step-13
        :end-before: step-14

.. todo:: remove extra blank line after break

    You should see the Floating IP output to the command line:

    ::

        <OpenStack_1_1_FloatingIpAddress: id=4536ed1e-4374-4d7f-b02c-c3be2cb09b67, ip_addr=203.0.113.101, pool=<OpenStack_1_1_FloatingIpPool: name=floating001>, driver=<libcloud.compute.drivers.openstack.OpenStack_1_1_NodeDriver object at 0x1310b50>>

    You can then go ahead and attach it to the instance:

    .. literalinclude:: ../../samples/libcloud/section1.py
        :start-after: step-14
        :end-before: step-15

Now go ahead and run the script to start the deployment.

Accessing the application
-------------------------

Deploying application data and configuration to the instance can take
some time. Consider enjoying a cup of coffee while you wait. After the
application has been deployed, you will be able to visit the awesome
graphic interface at the following link using your preferred
browser.

.. only:: libcloud

    .. literalinclude:: ../../samples/libcloud/section1.py
        :start-after: step-15

.. note:: If you are not using floating IPs, substitute another IP address as appropriate

Here's every code snippet into a single file, in case you want to run
it all in one, or you are so experienced you don't need instruction ;)
If you are going to use this, don't forget to set your authentication
information and the flavor and image ID.

.. only:: libcloud

    .. literalinclude:: ../../samples/libcloud/section1.py
