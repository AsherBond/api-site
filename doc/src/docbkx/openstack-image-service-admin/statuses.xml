  <para>
    Images in Glance can be in one the following statuses:
  </para>
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        <literal>queued</literal>
      </para>
      <para>
        The image identifier has been reserved for an image in the
        Glance registry. No image data has been uploaded to Glance.
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        <literal>saving</literal>
      </para>
      <para>
        Denotes that an image's raw data is currently being uploaded to
        Glance. When an image is registered with a call to `POST
        /images` and there is an `x-image-meta-location` header present,
        that image will never be in the `saving` status (as the image
        data is already available in some other location).
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        <literal>active</literal>
      </para>
      <para>
        Denotes an image that is fully available in Glance.
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        <literal>killed</literal>
      </para>
      <para>
        Denotes that an error occurred during the uploading of an
        image's data, and that the image is not readable.
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        <literal>deleted</literal>
      </para>
      <para>
        Glance has retained the information about the image, but it is
        no longer available to use. An image in this state will be
        removed automatically at a later date.
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        <literal>pending_delete</literal>
      </para>
      <para>
        This is similiar to `deleted`, however, Glance has not yet
        removed the image data. An image in this state is recoverable.
      </para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
