  <para>
    Glance may optionally be integrated with Keystone. Setting this up
    is relatively straightforward: the Keystone distribution includes
    the requisite middleware and examples of appropriately modified
    <literal>glance-api.conf</literal> and
    <literal>glance-registry.conf</literal> configuration files in the
    <literal>examples/paste</literal> directory. Once you have installed
    Keystone and edited your configuration files, newly created images
    will have their `owner` attribute set to the tenant of the
    authenticated users, and the `is_public` attribute will cause access
    to those images for which it is `false` to be restricted to only the
    owner.
  </para>
  
  <note>
<para>The exception is those images for which `owner` is set to `null`,
which may only be done by those users having the ``Admin`` role.
These images may still be accessed by the public, but will not
appear in the list of public images.  This allows the Glance
Registry owner to publish images for beta testing without allowing
those images to show up in lists, potentially confusing users.</para>

    <para>
      It is possible to allow a private image to be shared with one or
      more alternate tenants. This is done through image
      <emphasis>memberships</emphasis>, which are available via the
      `members` resource of images. (For more details, see
      :ref:`glanceapi`.) Essentially, a membership is an association
      between an image and a tenant which has permission to access that
      image. These membership associations may also have a `can_share`
      attribute, which, if set to `true`, delegates the authority to
      share an image to the named tenant.
